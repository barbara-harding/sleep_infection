The code in this R script accompany an analysis using data from the Rhea study (https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/5/1392/3882695), which is a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece.
We examined the effects of a) maternal sleep during pregnancy and b) childhood sleep at four years of age on the risk of infections across childhood (from 4-11 years of age).
We used cox proportional hazards regression models to model the associations between sleep (maternal and child) on infection risk over years of follow-up.
